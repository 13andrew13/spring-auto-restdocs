# restdocs-jackson
Preparation for open sourcing our Spring REST Dos extensions

## Already done

* split and removing of company-specific parts
* downgrade to Java 7

## Still to discuss

* Name of the project, currently `restdocs-jackson`
* Maven grouu ID / package names, currently `capital.scalable`. Is usually the inverse of a company URL. Thus, `com.scacap` is also possible.

## TODO

* tests
