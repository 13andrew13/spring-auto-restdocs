[[resources-items-get]]
=== Get an item

`GET /items/{id}`

==== Request structure

include::{snippets}/items/get/request-fields.adoc[]

We do not have to care whether to include a snippet or not,
because the template returns "No data." instead of an empty table.

=== Get all item

`GET /items`

As AsciiDoc is used, any additional information can be placed here and you don't have to care about formatting.
